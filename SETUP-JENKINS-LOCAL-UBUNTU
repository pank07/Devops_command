Yes! **You absolutely can set up Jenkins once** and make it **permanent** â€” so that even after rebooting WSL, your system, or Jenkins itself, you **don't have to set it up again**.
âœ… Once properly set, Jenkins will always remember:
- Admin user
- Plugins
- Jobs
- Credentials
- Everything
---
### ðŸ›  Hereâ€™s the correct **one-time setup plan** you should follow:
---
### 1. **Fix Jenkins Home Location (mandatory)**
You already saw this:
âœ” In `/etc/default/jenkins`, change:
```bash
JENKINS_HOME=/var/lib/jenkins
```
and **not** `/var/lib/$NAME`.
This ensures Jenkins knows where to save its data.
---
### 2. **Create an Admin User (not use initial setup always)**
During the very first install:
- Jenkins asks for the `initialAdminPassword`.
- Then you create your **first admin user** (e.g., `admin/admin123`).
- âœ… **Once created, Jenkins saves this inside** `/var/lib/jenkins/users/`.
**After that, Jenkins will not ask for unlock password again** unless:
- The `/var/lib/jenkins` data is lost or deleted.
- Jenkins home is wrongly configured.
---
### 3. **Make Sure Jenkins Service is Running**
Auto-start Jenkins when WSL boots:
- WSL doesnâ€™t automatically run `systemd` by default.
- You can manually start Jenkins each time you open WSL:
  ```bash
  sudo service jenkins start
  ```
- **OR** you can automate this!  
Would you like me to show how to auto-start Jenkins when WSL opens? (Itâ€™s a nice small script.)
---
### 4. **Backup Jenkins Data (optional but smart)**
Jenkins keeps all its important data in `/var/lib/jenkins`.

Backup it once in a while:
```bash
tar -czvf jenkins-backup.tar.gz /var/lib/jenkins
```
If something goes wrong, just restore from this backup.

### ðŸ“Œ Summary Checklist for One-Time Jenkins Setup
| Step | Command/Action |
|:---|:---|
| Fix Jenkins home | Edit `/etc/default/jenkins` |
| Create Admin user | During first login after install |
| Verify saved data | Check `/var/lib/jenkins/users/` |
| Start Jenkins on boot (optional) | Auto-run `sudo service jenkins start` |
| Backup regularly (optional) | `tar -czvf jenkins-backup.tar.gz /var/lib/jenkins` |
---
**ðŸ‘‰ So YES, once you properly set the JENKINS_HOME, create admin, and start Jenkins, you don't need to re-setup every time!**
---
Would you like me to quickly show you the script to **auto-start Jenkins automatically when WSL starts**? ðŸš€ (Itâ€™ll make your life easier â€” no need to manually `sudo service jenkins start`.)  
Should I?
